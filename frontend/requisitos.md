Generate the design for a homepage and main interface for a PDF/Image tool web application. The goal is a design that is an "improved copy" of the functionality of sites like iLovePDF, but with a minimalist, modern, and pleasing aesthetic.

🛠️ Technical Specifications and Stack
CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS v4 (use atomic classes and a highly responsive design).

JS Framework: Vue.js (the design should reflect the structure of a well-organized Vue component, with smooth animations and transitions for interactions).

Target: Single Page Application (SPA).

✨ Style and Aesthetics
Minimalism: The design should be clean, with plenty of white space to reduce cognitive load. Only essential elements should be present.

Modern: Elegant sans-serif typography, subtly rounded edges, and strategic use of soft shadows (if needed).

Pleasant and User-Friendly: The interface should feel intuitive and easy to use, with micro-interactions that guide the user.

Responsive Design: Seamless adaptation to mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

🌈 Exclusionary and Suggested Color Palette
❌ Strictly Exclude: Red, Orange, shades of Blue (navy, royal, sky, etc.), and pure/dark Gray.

✅ Suggested Main Palette (Colors to Use):

Primary Color (Action/Accent): A vibrant shade of Mint Green or a soft Lavender Purple. This should be the color for main buttons and the accent line.

Secondary Color (Background/Auxiliary Elements): A very light Creamy White or Off-White for the main background, and shades of Pale Green or Light Beige for card or section backgrounds.

Typography/Iconography: Soft black (almost charcoal) for the main text.

🖼️ Interface Structure
The interface should center around a Tools Panel (Options Grid) and, when one is selected, a Task View (Drop Zone).

1. Home Page / Tools Panel
Present the 9 functionalities as square or rectangular cards in a responsive grid (3x3 on desktop, 2xN on mobile).

Each card should have:

A large, representative icon (line icon style or duotone).

A clear title for the function (e.g., "PDF to Word").

A very brief description (e.g., "Transform your PDFs into editable documents").

On hover, there should be a subtle hover animation or accent color change.

Header: Minimalist logo and a secondary navigation menu if necessary (e.g., "Blog", "Pricing").

Main Call to Action (CTA): A large headline describing the service (e.g., "Your PDF and Image Tool Suite. Easy and Free.").

2. Task View (After Clicking on a Tool)
Central Drop Zone: A large, visually prominent area with dashed borders that invites the user to drag and drop files. It should clearly indicate the accepted formats.

Include a large primary "Select Files" button with the main accent color.

Display a secondary option to upload from the cloud.

Options Panel (Side or Floating): A smaller area that appears once the files have been uploaded (e.g., choosing compression quality, selecting the page range, etc.).

Uploaded Files List: Displays the thumbnails or file names, with the option to delete or reorder them.

Final Execution Button: A floating or fixed button at the bottom/corner, labeled with the final action (e.g., "Compress PDF," "Convert to Word").

🚀 Specific Design Functionalities
The design must include the interface visualization for the following 9 tools:

Convert: PDF -> Word

Convert: Word -> PDF

Merge: PDF (Demonstrates how to drag and drop multiple files and reorder them).

Convert: PDF -> IMG (Displays the options panel to choose the format: PNG/JPG).

Convert: IMG -> PDF (Displays the options panel to choose the orientation: Portrait/Landscape).

Convert: IMG -> Other Formats (Displays a dropdown menu to select the output format, e.g., WEBP, GIF, etc.).

Compress PDF: Displays the options panel to choose the compression level (Low, Medium, High) using sliders or buttons.

Extracting Text from a PDF: Displays the upload area and, once processed, a button to "Download Text (.txt)."

Extracting Text from an Image (OCR): Displays the upload area and the option to choose the text language.
